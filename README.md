Project Title: StudyHack
Problem: Theme 2, Problem Statement 2

## Introduction

The transition to remote education has revealed significant limitations in existing virtual classroom tools.
Communication inefficiencies, lack of interactive opportunities, and reduced student engagement are persistent challenges.

A 2023 OECD study reported that 42% of educators consider current virtual collaboration tools inadequate for interactive learning. Most platforms do not support real-time engagement or provide effective assessment feedback mechanisms in remote settings.

Our solution aims to address these issues with an interactive mobile quiz application designed for real-time engagement between teachers and students.

## Solution

Our proposed mobile application enables:

- Real-time quizzes with immediate feedback and performance analytics.
- Live interaction between teachers and students during lessons.
- Engagement tools such as polls, peer feedback, and gamified question formats.
- Mobile-first design for accessibility and ease of use on both Android and iOS.
- Lightweight operation optimized for low bandwidth environments.

Features

- Live Quizzes: Teachers can create and post questions in real-time.
- Instant Analytics: Students and teachers get immediate feedback on quiz results.
- Peer Feedback: Option to review and rate responses from peers.
- Teacher Dashboard: Manage questions, view class performance, and track engagement.
- Security & Privacy: Secure logins and data encryption for safe access.

## Technical Considerations

Platform: Built with React Native for cross-platform mobile support.
Backend:
Bandwidth Management:
Cybersecurity: Role-based authentication and HTTPS protocols.
Accessibility: Minimal UI for low-spec devices and multilingual support.
Teacher Training: Built-in tutorials and onboarding guidance for educators.
